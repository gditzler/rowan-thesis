First of all, I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Robi Polikar for allowing me
the opportunity to work with his team in the Signal Processing \& Pattern 
Recognition Laboratory. He has been a constant source of encouragement throughout 
my graduate education. I would like to thank my committee members, Dr. Shreekanth 
Mandayam and Dr. Nancy Tinkham, for their patience and guidance throughout the 
thesis defense process. Furthermore, I would like to thank the graduate students 
in the SPPRL and virtual reality labs. Special thanks go out to Ryan Ewell for 
preparing the NOAA weather dataset. Finally, I thank my family for their 
continued support.
